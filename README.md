Airbnb Review Score Prediction: Enhancing Guest Satisfaction through Feature Analysis and Modeling


Overview:


This project uses machine learning techniques to predict review scores for Airbnb listings. The goal is to develop accurate regression models that can estimate review scores based on various features and attributes of the listings. The dataset includes information such as price, location, amenities, and descriptions of the listings.


Key Steps and Features:


1. Data Preprocessing: The project starts by cleaning and preparing the dataset. Features are carefully selected and processed to ensure they are suitable for model training.

2. Model selection and Tuning: Multiple regression models are explored, including Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Linear Regression, and Stacking Hyperparameters are tuned using techniques like Grid Search to optimize model performance.

3. Evaluation Metrics: models are evaluated using standard regression metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R2 score. These metrics provide insights into how well the models predict review scores.

4. Ensemble Techniques: Stacking, an ensemble technique, is employed to combine the strengths of different models, potentially improving predictive accuracy.

5. Future Directions: Potential future enhancements include incorporating Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze listing descriptions and explore their influence on review scores.

6. Ranking Models: Models are ranked based on their performance metrics, highlighting the most accurate and effective ones for predicting review scores.


Impact and Applications:


This project has practical applications for both Airbnb hosts and guests. Hosts can use the predictive models to gain insights into factors that influence review scores and make informed decisions to improve their listings. Guests benefit from more accurate expectations of their Airbnb experience based on the predicted review scores. 

The project's insights enhance the overall Airbnb ecosystem, providing valuable information to hosts and guests alike.
